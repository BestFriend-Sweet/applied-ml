[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Have a new ML project (work or personal) and need a _starting_ point? These resources on **ML applied in the real world** share:

- **How** the problem is framed üîé(e.g., personalization as recsys vs. search vs. sequences)
- **What** machine learning techniques worked ‚úÖ (and sometimes, what didn't ‚ùå)
- **Why** it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and references üìÇ
- **What** real-world results were achieved (so you can better assess ROI ‚è∞üí∞üìà)
